=== Run options.py

To run the `options.py` file, you first need the following items;

* Your Robinhood Account Number
* A valid Authorization Header Token

You can view these by intercepting any of the API calls that the Robinhood web application executes.

Open the Developer view of your browser and navigate to the Network tab. Select a network call, then look at the request headers. You will see a request header like this: `Authorization: Bearer long-token-string`.

The account number will likely be in the Api's URL.

Once you have obtained the above two values, the file can be run as follows:

----
export ACCOUNT_NUMBER=YOUR-ACCOUNT-NUMBER
export AUTH_HEADER="Bearer long-token-string"
python3 options.py
