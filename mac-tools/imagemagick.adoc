= ImageMagick

I was looking for a way to merge two screenshots together on a Mac.

It was a little difficult to do so manually, so I looked for tools online.

Found this free utility, imagemagick.

Here is how I used it.

Install: `brew install imagemagick`

Merge _a.png_ and _b.png_ horizontally and save it to _c.png_:

`magick a.png b.png +append c.png`

Merge _a.png_ and _b.png_ horizontally and save it to _c.png_:

`magick a.png b.png -append c.png`
